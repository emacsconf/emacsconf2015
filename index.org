** To-do state explanation

- IDEA (or none): Might be a good talk. No one has signed up for it yet
- IDENTIFIED: Potential speakers for this have been identified
- INVITED: Someone has actually reached out to the potential speakers and invited them =)
- ACCEPTED: A speaker for this has accepted
- SCHED: We actually have a timeslot and everything =D

** Current plans

- Baseline: Google Hangout all day, very informal, might even just be a couple of people learning about Emacs and occasionally talking about what they discover.
- Better: Google Hangout, spontaneous talks occur. Sacha edits the videos afterwards and posts highlights.
- Even better: There are scheduled talks which people prepare for. (See talk ideas below.) Sacha edits the videos afterwards and posts chunks for easy reviewing.
- Amazing: We have so much planned, we end up with parallel tracks or additional Hangouts.

** Ideas for sessions
*** IDENTIFIED The State of Emacs

The kernel of this idea is basically to have a "State of the Union" address, where the Union is Emacs. I think it would be awesome if someone really embedded in Emacs development (specifically thinking of Stefan) talked about the current state of Emacs development with regards to
- how development today is functioning. What are major development process problems that need to be fixed but haven't? What do the maintainers of Emacs stress about (letting patches rot in debbugs, having bugs rot in debbugs, being unsure of the general brokenness of Emacs because of the lack of testing), and what processes can be put in place to ease their anxieties?
- new contributors. Making Emacs easier for new contributors was a *huge* topic in the Fall of 2014 on emacs-devel. The switch to git was seen as the first step, what were the next steps and how did they work?
- whether anything surprisingly good/bad has happened this year.
- the general state of emacs-devel.
- and what we can do to help! :D
(suggested by Samer)

Possible people:
- Stefan Monnier?

**** IDENTIFIED Guile Emacs
   I think it would be awesome if Robin Templeton or BT Templeton (there is a chance that they're the same person, I'm still not clear on that...) talked about the state of Guile Emacs.
   - What works? What's left to be done?
   - What does Guile replace in the core Emacs engine?
   - *Is Guile Emacs the future of Emacs?* Is Guile Emacs going to *happen* and be merged into trunk at some point in the future? If so, what's needed to get us there, otherwise, why not?
   And what can we do to help! :D :D

***** IDEA interactive development

  I'd love some talks about *interactive* development with Emacs: making changes in code and getting immediate feedback. (Think lighttable.) The Emacs Rocks episode about swank-js is a perfect example of what I mean: http://emacsrocks.com/e11.html.

** What is EmacsConf?

EmacsConf is a conference about the joy of Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and memorizing key sequences.

EmacsConf is about bringing the people that use Emacs together. EmacsConf, like Emacs itself, is wholely owned by the community, and anyone may contribute to it (see "How to get involved!").

** How to get involved!

First, join our google group emacsconf-org (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/emacsconf-org). All important messages & announcements go through there. If you want to help, please ping the list or our IRC channel! We're super friendly, so don't stress about getting in contact with us :)

** To-do state explanation

- IDEA (or none): Might be a good talk. No one has signed up for it yet
- IDENTIFIED: Potential speakers for this have been identified
- INVITED: Someone has actually reached out to the potential speakers and invited them =)
- ACCEPTED: A speaker for this has accepted
- SCHED: We actually have a timeslot and everything =D

** Current plans

- Baseline: Google Hangout all day, very informal, might even just be a couple of people learning about Emacs and occasionally talking about what they discover.
- Better: Google Hangout, spontaneous talks occur. Sacha edits the videos afterwards and posts highlights.
- Even better: There are scheduled talks which people prepare for. (See talk ideas below.) Sacha edits the videos afterwards and posts chunks for easy reviewing.
- Amazing: We have so much planned, we end up with parallel tracks or additional Hangouts.

** Ideas for sessions
*** IDENTIFIED The State of Emacs

The kernel of this idea is basically to have a "State of the Union" address, where the Union is Emacs. I think it would be awesome if someone really embedded in Emacs development (specifically thinking of Stefan) talked about the current state of Emacs development with regards to
- how development today is functioning. What are major development process problems that need to be fixed but haven't? What do the maintainers of Emacs stress about (letting patches rot in debbugs, having bugs rot in debbugs, being unsure of the general brokenness of Emacs because of the lack of testing), and what processes can be put in place to ease their anxieties?
- new contributors. Making Emacs easier for new contributors was a *huge* topic in the Fall of 2014 on emacs-devel. The switch to git was seen as the first step, what were the next steps and how did they work?
- whether anything surprisingly good/bad has happened this year.
- the general state of emacs-devel.
- and what we can do to help! :D
(suggested by Samer)

**** IDENTIFIED Guile Emacs
   I think it would be awesome if Robin Templeton or BT Templeton (there is a chance that they're the same person, I'm still not clear on that...) talked about the state of Guile Emacs.
   - What works? What's left to be done?
   - What does Guile replace in the core Emacs engine?
   - *Is Guile Emacs the future of Emacs?* Is Guile Emacs going to *happen* and be merged into trunk at some point in the future? If so, what's needed to get us there, otherwise, why not?
   And what can we do to help! :D :D

** Code of Conduct

Our goal with EmacsConf is to bring the Emacs programming community together for a conference about the joy of Emacs and Emacs Lisp.

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by EmacsConf or not.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any EmacsConf event are required to observe the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

**Why have a code of conduct?** Not because we feel like we're expected to have one; not because someone told us to; not because we heard somewhere that it was important for some reason — but **as part of an intentional effort to define the culture EmacsConf.**

*** The Short Version

EmacsConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for EmacsConf.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

*** The Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, derisive comments regarding technical background, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for EmacsConf.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates the anti-harassment policy, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

*** Social Rules

In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a small set of [[https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules][social rules]] we follow. We (the organizers) learned and lifted these rules from [[https://www.recurse.com/][the Recurse Center]], where we felt that they contributed enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment. We'd like EmacsConf to share that environment. These rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more explicit certain social norms that are normally implicit. Most of our social rules really boil down to “don't be a jerk“ or “don't be annoying.” Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling people not to be jerks isn't a very productive strategy.

Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will not result in expulsion from the conference or a strong warning from conference organizers. Rather, they are designed to provide some lightweight social structure for conference attendees to use when interacting with each other.

[[https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules][The social rules]].

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please feel free to reach out to any of the conference organizers.

*** Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff.

If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact any of these individuals:

    Samer Masterson - (703) 225 8132
    (add find another organizer here)

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
